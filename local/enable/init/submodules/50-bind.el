(defmacro bind--singular (form)
  "Process a single bind FORM and bind many keys to many keymaps.
FORM's first element can be a keymap, list of keymaps, a function
returning keymap (`setq') or keymaps (a user function). It is
quoted, if it is a keymap or a list of keymaps.

FORM's rest elements must be bindings. A binding is in the form
of 'KEY DEF' where KEY and DEF has the same specs as in
`define-key', in the case of `bind'. It is up to `bind--definer'
what to do with KEY and DEF.

About global and local bindings,

Instead of using different functions for different cases, `bind'
chooses to be verbose about them. In every case, at the end, each
binding is put in a keymap. Use `bind-global-map' and
`bind-local-map' functions to get the keymap for the case you
want. While `bind-global-map' simply
returns `current-global-map', `bind-local-map' implements the
behavior in `local-set-key'.

About processing functions,

Most of the arguments in FORM is evaluated such that `bind'
behaves like a function so they are not quoted and will be
evaluated, unless said so. That way, bindings can be processed.
For example, there are `bind-prefix', `bind-autoload' and
`bind-repeat' processing functions. They take bindings as input
and return bindings and possibly transforming bindings but not
required to. They can be nested and used many times as one
wants. User can easily define its processing function. User is
encouraged to make use of `bind-keyp', `bind-foreach-key-def',
`bind-flatten1-key-of-bindings' and `bind-with-metadata' utility
functions for their custom behavior. See default processing
functions' definitions for examples.

See commentary or homepage for examples."
